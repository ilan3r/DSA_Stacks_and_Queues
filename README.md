Implementing a circular queue and a dynamic stack. 
Circular queue is first in first out (like a line).  When the queue is initialized, the capacity is specified, and as the queue is enqueued or dequeued, the size must change. Since the queue is circular, the head (front) and tail (back) of the queue change when enqueue or dequeue occurs.

Dynamic stack is last in first out (like a stack of plates). Dynamic stack refers to a stack whose size is changed (depending on how full the stack is) using dynamic memory allocation. If the size of the stack is less than a quarter of the capacity, the capacity can be halved. If the stack has reached capacity, double the capacity.
